This is our calculator binary from a long long time ago...(when the code compiled).  It can be tested with the argument variables "rational" and "test".


So, to run this from a terminal, type ./calculator rational or ./calculator test.

Note: to test the arithmetic, your results are not cummulative.  For example, if you do addition, multiplication, and division, the test in main does not keep track of the running total, each successive operation is on the original rational number you created. (Its a feature, not a bug).  Also, to select 'yes' or 'no' when asked whether you want to test addition/substraction/..etc , simply type 'y' for yes and 'n' for no.  


A final note: old_calculator_test and calculator are the same file.
