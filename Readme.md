The basic breakdown of responsibilities:

Justin : Parser, Calculator, Expression, Operator, Token, Number, Constant, and Main. Parts of Integer, and general bugs. 

Ian : Exponent (which was later made a member function of all the Number subclasses) and Tokenizer , Rational class constructors

Hanif : Rational Class , also getting Integer to work with Parser later.  

Kyle : Integer, Main, Constant, Log bug fixes  

Tylor : Radical Class

Nick : Logarithm class, edits to other classes to work with log class

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Build the project by typing 'make' in the main directory of the project. This should build an executable called calulator that runs directly in a terminal.

See the branches of our project (and the commits) at the following link: 
https://github.com/UF-COP-3053-Group/COP-3503-Project 

"working" is the branch used for submission.

"With-Wolfram" is a branch of our caclulator that uses Wolfram Alpha as a simplification engine. It can even do trig and derivatives!

Our /docs directory contains the submission files from part 1 of the project. 

/src contains the source files, as expected. 

/temp contains two .cpp files for dealing with primes numbers, which may be useful later.  It also contains the Radical.cpp/.h and Log.cpp/.h files which still have some bugs but will be incorporated in the final program.
