I went ahead and made a basic file structure:
-temp: for temporary/testing files.  I have 2 files in here for prime numbers that might be useful later
-A Makefile: which will be edited once we have our core src files wokring,
-docs: documentation, UML, etc
-inc: header files
-src: .cpp files go here 

If you are using eclipse or any other IDE, you might want to get your project structure to match this one.  Also, feel free to make any improvements as you feel necessary.
